\section*{Create a Folder Two Ways}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Lesson 3: Create a Folder Two Ways}
The BrailleNote is a computer. With it, you can complete word processing tasks, use the planner to set and keep appointments, and send and receive e-mail messages. Just like on the computer, there is often more than one way to complete a task. This is true for creating folders. In this lesson, you will learn two ways of creating folders. After practicing both methods, you may decide which one is best for you.

\section{Cut, Copy, and Paste}
In many BrailleNote applications, it is helpful to use the Block Commands menu. By using this menu, you can complete a variety of tasks such as deleting a block of text, copying text to the clipboard, and pasting text in a new location. For example, when on a web page, you might find it helpful to copy a block of text onto the clipboard. That text may be placed in a word processor document or in an e-mail message. In this lesson, you will learn about the Block Commands Menu.
\subsection{Tasks}

			            \item Delete block: delete the text that is blocked.
			            \item Insert file: insert file at cursor position.
			            \item Move block to clipboard: remove text from original location and place on the clipboard. This is often referred to as "cutting" text to the clipboard.
			            \item Paste clipboard: take text from the clipboard and place it at the cursor position.
			            \item Read block: read the text within the block (top block marker and bottom block marker.
			            \item Store the block: store the block of text in a specified location.

As with most word processors, the BrailleNote word processor, Keyword, has a spelling checker. The BrailleNote will give you the choices of checking the entire document, one word, a paragraph or section, or from the cursor to the end of the document. You also have the option to look up a word. In this lesson, you or your student will learn to check an entire document for spelling errors.
\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Practice:
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Create a new document.
		      \item Write several sentences. Misspell at least one word in each sentence.
		      \item Open the spelling checker \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ Press space + dots16. }}}}
		      \item "Spelling checker menu" is displayed by the BrailleNote.
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item document check
			            \item look up word
			            \item word check
			            \item paragraph or section check
			            \item check from cursor to end of document
		            \end{itemize}

\section{Set up WiFi}
The BrailleNote has a web browser application called Key Web. As with web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox, Key Web can be used to read and interact with web pages. You can conduct a search using google, check your Facebook page, or download a book from Bookshare. There are many ways to use Key Web for completing Internet tasks.

The first job to be done is to set up the wireless connection. Students may help with this task so that setting up a wireless connection can be completed in other environments more independently. Students may want to use a wireless connection at home or in a public library.

\subsection{Tasks}
Below is a sample of how to connect the BrailleNote to wireless Internet that is an open connection with no password required. Setting up a wireless or LAN connection varies depending on the settings that are in place. For school connections, the IT staff may be able to help. It is often helpful to have HumanWare tech support on the phone while working with IT staff. Arrange times with all concerned ahead of time if possible. 
Sample of Setting Up a Wireless Connection:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Turn BrailleNote on.
	\item Open Options Menu \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ space + o }}}}
	\item Connectivity Options \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ letter c }}}}
	\item Setup Options for Wireless Internet \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ letter w }}}}
	\item "Wireless Ethernet on? Currently no" is displayed.
	\item Toggle on \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ letter y }}}}
	\item Scan for Available Connections \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ letter s  }}}}
	\item Find your connection in list \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ space / backspace, enter }}}}
	\item "Entry list for connection configurations"
	\item Go to first field \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ down arrow }}}}
	\item "Connection configuration name?" is displayed along with the name of your connection name.
	\item Move to next field \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ advance thumb-key }}}}
	\item "Obtain an IP address automatically? Yes" is displayed.
	\item Move to next field \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ advance thumb-key }}}}
	\item "use a proxy server for this connection? No" is displayed.
	\item If I wanted the option to say yes \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ letter y  }}}}
	      \begin{itemize}\item if I did change to "yes" other fields and choices would become available.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Context dependent help \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ space + h }}}}
	\item When you finish with the settings, exit \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ space + e  }}}}
	\item "Add this record?" \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ letter y for yes. }}}}
	\item "Wireless Ethernet menu" is displayed.
	\item "reconnect using existing configurations" \dotfill {\textcolor{accent}{\MakeUppercase{\textbf{ space + enter. }}}}
	\item If your settings are correct, you will be connected to the wireless connection.
	\item You will not have to repeat this process
\end{enumerate}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Lesson 1: Getting Started}

Skills:
Learn where the BrailleNote keys are located.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Six Braille writer keys
	\item Space
	\item Backspace
	\item Enter
	\item Previous thumb-key
	\item Back thumb-key
	\item Advance thumb-key

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ask your student to open the cover of the BrailleNote. The cover should open away from the BrailleNote user.  If the BrailleNote is positioned correctly, your student will recognize six Braille writer keys and a spacebar which are similar to that of a Perkins Braille writer.
	      
	\item Assist your student in locating the on off switch.  This switch is located under the velcro flap toward the back of the left panel of the BrailleNote.
	      
	\item Without turning the BrailleNote on, explain that when the rocker switch is indented toward the user, the BrailleNote is on.  When the on off switch is indented away from the user, the BrailleNote is off.
	      
	\item Allow your student to feel the headphone jack.  It is on the left panel of the BrailleNote toward the front.
	      
	\item Instruct your BrailleNote user to place his or her hands on the six Braille writer keys as he or she would do on a Braille writer.  An easy task for your student will be to identify dotsone through six and the space.
	      
	      
	      
	\item The key near the left edge of the BrailleNote, to the left of the dot3 Braille writer key, is the backspace key.  Show your student how to press this key using the pinky finger of the left hand.
	      
	      
	      
	\item The key next to the right edge of the BrailleNote, to the right of the dot6 Braille writer key, is the enter key.  Instruct your student to place his or her right pinky on this key.  The BrailleNote should still be turned off during this introductory lesson.
	      
	      
	      
	\item The refreshable Braille display is below the spacebar.  Though the BrailleNote is off; your student may place his or her hands on this Braille display.
	\item While your student is exploring the refreshable Braille display, he or she may place both thumbs down on the thumb-keys to explore them.  The thumb-keys are on the front panel of the BrailleNote.
	\item Starting at the left, the thumb-keys are called the previous, back, advance, and next thumb-keys.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Quiz}
Have your student point to each of the following as you give the instruction.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Earphone jack
	\item Spacebar
	\item Next thumb-key
	\item on and off rocker switch
	\item Previous thumb-key
	\item Backspace
	\item Advance thumb-key
	\item Back thumb-key
	\item Return (enter) key
	\item Keys one through six

\section*{Lesson 2: Navigating Menus}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Lesson 2: Navigating Menus}


Goals:



\begin{enumerate}
	\item Turn the BrailleNote on or off.
	      
	\item Use space to go forward through menu items.
	      
	\item Use backspace to go back through menu items.
	      
	\item Use the advance thumb-key to move forward through menu items and the back thumb-key to move to previous menu items.
	      
	\item When on a menu item, press enter to open it.
	      
	\item Use initial letters to move to and open menu items.
	      
	\item Use space with e to exit a menu.
	      
	\item Toggle among BrailleNote speech settings.
	      
	\item Use and understand space with h to get help from anywhere.
	      
	\item Use the shortcut to return to the Main Menu.
\end{enumerate}



 \subsection{Tasks}:



Complete the following tasks with your student: Make changes according to the needs and ability of your student.



a. Instruct your student to turn on the BrailleNote. Give any help that

is necessary.



b. If the speech is off, turn it on.  Do this yourself or assist your student in holding down the previous thumb-key and pressing space to toggle through the speech on, speech off, and speech on request modes.  Stop toggling among the choices when you hear, "speech on." Remember, the previous thumb-key is the left-most thumb-key on the front panel of the BrailleNote.



c. Allow your student to use space to move forward through the menu items.  Listen to the item names as you go over the items.



d. When the end of the menu items are reached, the student may use backspace to move back through the list to return to the Main Menu.



e. Help your student to use the advance thumb-key to move forward through the various menu items and the back thumb-key to move to previous menu items.



f. At the Main Menu, your student may press space to go forward to the keyword menu option.  Press enter to select and go into the keyword menu.  By continuing to use space, he or she can explore keyword options.  Press space with e to back out of menu options.



g. At the Main Menu, your student may press e for the e-mail option called keymail.  The menu item automatically opens.  Your student may use space to explore e-mail options or space with e to return to the other menu items.



h. At the Main Menu, press space with h to get help.  Use the advance thumb-key option to read the help information on the Braille display or to hear it read.  To move back while in help, use the back thumb-key.  An e with space will exit the help menu.  Space with h to get help is available from anywhere on the BrailleNote.



i. Now your student may practice turning the speech on, off, and speech on request.  This is done by using the key combination of previous thumb-key and space.  This combination will toggle between the three modes.  Speech on request only uses speech when specific speech commands are pressed.  For the time being, toggle to speech on.  The previous thumb-key will need to be held down while tapping space.



j. From the Main Menu, instruct your student to press an i to go to the Internet prompt.  The speech and Braille display may say "address." If the student was using the Internet, this is where he or she would type in a web address.  We won't complete this task right now.  From anywhere in the BrailleNote, dots1 through 6 may be pressed with the space to return to the Main Menu.  Request that your student complete this command now.



i. Ask your student to turn the BrailleNote off when all tasks are complete.



For instructional purposes, you may need to have the speech on in order to hear what your student is doing on the BrailleNote. Use ear buds so that your student must read the Braille display. You may want to hold off on introducing speech until your student is older. Using the Braille display will enhance Braille reading and writing skills.

Lesson 2

\subsection{Quiz}



It's time for a Quiz.  Require your student to demonstrate competency in the following tasks.  This could be accomplished by using a written test or by requiring the student to use the BrailleNote to demonstrate mastery of the skills.



1. Turn on the BrailleNote.



2. If the BrailleNote does not say Main Menu, your student can return to it by using space with e or a full cell with space.



3.  At the Main Menu, ask the student to show you how he or she can get to the Internet prompt and open it by using only one letter.  If necessary, give a verbal cue to the student to press the letter i.



4.  Instruct your student to return to the Main Menu.  He or she should do this by using either e with space or dots1 through 6 with space.



5.  From the Main Menu, encourage your student to show you how to move forward and backward through the menu items using two different methods.  These methods are using space and backspace keys and using the back and advance thumb-keys.



6.  From the Main Menu, instruct your student to go to the e-mail menu item and open it.  This is done by pressing an e.  Do not provide verbal cues unless they are necessary during this Quiz section.



7. From the keymail menu, ask your student to show you how he or she would get help.  If a reminder is required, state that space with h will get help from anywhere.



8.  Ask your student to read what is in the help file.  The back and advance thumb-keys will work for now.



9.  Ask your student to return to the Main Menu.  Remember, pressing e with space or a full cell with space will accomplish this task.



10. Your student may now turn the BrailleNote off.



Note to Remember:



To switch from task to task on the BrailleNote quickly, use the backspace and enter held down with the letter of the application you want to open.  For example, backspace enter b will automatically open the book reader from anywhere.  Backspace enter e will open keymail from anywhere.  You get the idea!

	\item Next you and your student will be prompted to determine the folder you would like to place the document in.  Like a paper folder or large envelope, your
	      
	\item BrailleNote folder will contain or hold your smaller documents.  For now, you may press enter on the general folder.  To go to this folder, press g, the folder's initial letter.  Also, you may space to the general folder to navigate to it.  Press enter to continue.
	      
	\item Now name the file.  Call the file anything you want.  Use uncontracted or contracted Braille.  File names can be up to 250 characters long.
	      
	\item When in the document, instruct your student to write his name, the date, and the word Practice.  A new line should be placed between the name, date, and the word Practice.  After the word Practice, enter can be pressed twice for two new lines.  If an error is made, give a reminder that backspace can be used to delete the previous character.
	      
	\item Now your student may write two or three sentences to get a feel for what writing in the word processor is like.
	      
	\item The cursor keys are above the Braille display.  Show your student that he or she can place the cursor in any location by pressing the cursor key above the desired Braille cell.  Corrections can be made by using the cursor keys and the backspace for deleting errors.  The student may simply correct errors with the backspace and writing the desired text in the correct place.
	      
	\item Listed below are commands that can be used on the BrailleNote.  The current document will be too small to practice them all, but a quick review won't hurt.  Review commands are especially helpful when the speech is being used.
	      
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item To move back a character, press space with dot3.
		            
		      \item Space with dot6 will move forward by character.
		            
		      \item Space with dot2 will move back by word.
		            
		      \item Dot5 with a space will move forward by word.
		            
		      \item To move back by a sentence, press space with dot1.
		            
		      \item To move forward by a sentence, press space with dot4.

	      \end{enumerate}
	\item The back and advance thumb-keys will move forward and back by one width of the Braille display.  Practice this in the word processing document that you currently have open.  If desired, Braille a few more sentences or a paragraph for practice purposes. Younger students may practice writing letters and words.
	      
	\item Your student may practice turning the speech on and off at this time.
	      
	\item Turning the speech on and off is done by using the previous thumb-key and the space together.  This toggles between speech on, speech off, and speech on request.  Speech on request is spoken when specific commands related to speech are given. Skip this step if you are not teaching the student to turn the speech on and off at this time.
	      
	\item The next thumb-key and the space will turn the Braille display on and off.  Explore this option.  The speech and Braille display cannot both be off at the same time.
	      
	\item Next, press space with o to go to the options menu.  Then press a p to hear the level of remaining power.  When the power gets as low as 10 or 20 percent, be sure to plug the adapter in and give the BrailleNote a charge.  To return to your document after checking the power, press the next thumb-key to clear the display and go back to where you were.  Try this out now.
	      
	\item Turn the BrailleNote off now.

\end{enumerate}



 \subsection{Tasks}:



Complete the tasks below with your student.  Add to the activity as appropriate.



\begin{enumerate}
	\item Request that the student enter the Homework or other folder and then open or create a journal file.
	      
	\item Your student may go to the end of the document by using a space with dots4 5 6.
	      
	\item Write the date followed by two enters for two new lines.
	      
	\item Make a journal entry.  Do not allow your student to make corrections as they occur so that practice with the spelling checker can be gained.
	      
	\item In the document, your student may locate a word that is not spelled correctly.  If all words appear to be correct, change and misspell some of the words for your student.
	      
	\item Your student should now place the cursor on a misspelled word.  Use dots1 and 6 with space to enter the spelling checker.
	      
	\item Space or use the advance thumb-key to get to the word check option.  Press enter.
	      
	\item If a word cannot be found or you need to fix a word, use the spell checker to do so.  The following options are available when trying to fix a misspelled word:
	      
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Use i to ignore all occurrences of the word.
		            
		      \item Space with dot5 will fix only the occurrence of the word that your student is currently working with.
		            
		      \item The letter a will add the word to the spelling dictionary.
		            
		      \item The letter c will help correct the word.
		            
		      \item To look up a word, press l.
		            
		      \item For suggestions, press s.
		            
		      \item Practice checking words at this time until you and your student adjust to using the word check option.
		            
		            
	      \end{enumerate}
	\item If your student is unsure of the correct spelling of a word or unsure of the correct Braille sign, use the "lookup word" option in the spelling checker.  Press dots1 and 6 to enter the spelling checker.  Press space to get to the "lookup word" option.  Press enter.
	      
	\item At the word to look up cue, write a word in grade 1 Braille and press enter.
	      
	\item If the word that is found is the one your student wants, he or she should press enter to insert it into the document.  To move up and down the list of word suggestions, use backspace or space.  You may also use the back and advance thumb-keys.  Press enter on a word if you choose to insert it into a document.  When finished, press e with space to exit the spelling checker.
	      
	\item Practice using the other spelling checker options with your student.  Using the BrailleNote is the best way to get to know it, so practice and explore as time allows.  Spelling checker options include document check, look up word, word check, paragraph or section check, and check document from the cursor to the end.
	      
	\item Remember; use space with h to get help when you need it.

	\item Send an attachment.
	      
	\item Use the address selection list to attain a recipient e-mail address.
	      
	\item Access and understand the e-mail action menu.
\end{enumerate}



 \subsection{Tasks}



This lesson assumes that you have addresses in your BrailleNote address book that contain e-mail addresses.



\begin{enumerate}
	\item Instruct your student to open Keymail.
	      
	\item Space or use the next thumb-key to locate "write an e-mail".  Press enter.
	      
	\item At the "send to" prompt, press backspace with dots1 2 3 to get to the "selection list for address" prompt.
	      
	\item Your student should move to the field of his or her choice.  For this lesson, first or last name will probably be best.  On the desired field, write the name of the recipient you want to e-mail and press enter.
	      
	\item $``$One record selected. Send to all recipients?" will be the cue.  Press a y for yes.  At this time you and your student will be taken to the "also send to" field.
	      
	\item If you would like your student to send the message to someone else, either write the e-mail address or use backspace with dots1 2 3 to go to the address selection option.
	      
	\item The next step to assist your student with is to move through the e-mail fields.  At the subject field, your student should get in the habit of writing a one or two word descriptive subject.  Then use the next thumb-key to get to the attachment field.
	      
	\item The BrailleNote user is then given the question, "attach a file to this e-mail?" Your student should press a y for yes to gain practice in attaching a file to an e-mail message.
	      
	\item The next prompt is "folder name".  Use space or the next thumb-key to go to the folder where there is a keyword file stored that you can attach for practice. Press enter.
	      
	\item $``$File to attach?" is the next question.  Use the next thumb-key or space to the file you want to attach and press enter.
	      
	\item $``$Attach this keyword document in another file type?" is the next cue. Key in a y for yes.  Microsoft Word is a common file type that most computer users can access.  For now let's attach the file as a Microsoft Word document.
	      
	\item $``$Attach as which file type?" is the next question.  Your display may already say "Microsoft Word." Press enter to attach the file as a Microsoft Word document.
	      
	\item Now your student will be asked if he or she would like to attach another file.  Write an n for no at this point.
	      
	\item Your student will find the e-mail message.  He or she may write a message.  A note about the file that is attached and the reason for it would be very appropriate and polite.  When your student is finished writing the message, he or she may press space with e.
	      
	\item $``$Ready to send this message?" If the message is good to go, your student should press y.  "Save a copy?" can probably be responded to with an n for no at this time.  As you leave Keymail, you will be prompted to send the message.  Key in a y for yes or n for no.
	      
	\item Now it's time for your student and you to learn about the e-mail action menu.  This feature comes in handy in cases where the BrailleNote user wants to forward an e-mail message, reply to an e-mail message, or move an e-mail message to a different folder.
	      
	\item When you are focused on or in an e-mail message, you can access the e-mail action menu by pressing space with dots2 and 6.  "E-mail action menu" will be spoken or displayed.  The choices in the e-mail action menu are:
	      
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Reply

\section*{Lesson 22: File List}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Lesson 22: File List}


Skills Checklist



\begin{enumerate}
	\item Get information about a file.
	      
	\item View other document types.
	      
	\item Determine the order in which files are displayed.
	      
	\item Copy a file.
	      
	\item Move a file.
	      
	\item Rename a file.
	      
	\item Protect or unprotect a file.
	      
	\item Mark one file or all files.
	      
	      
	      
	       \subsection{Tasks}
	      
	      
	      
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item From a list of files, use space with h to hear all available commands.  These items will be reviewed in this lesson.
		            
		      \item You can get information about the "pointed to" file in the file list within a folder.  Space with i will allow you to get details about the file.  You will learn what type of file you are focused on, the file size, when the file was last modified, and if the file is protected or unprotected.  Try using space with i when pointed to a variety of files to get an idea of what information you can get.
		            
		      \item Use space with x to view other types of files.  If you want to view all files in the folder, use space with x until the View All Files option is displayed.  Space with x will toggle to the various file types.
		            
		      \item You can determine the order in which files are displayed by using space with v.  Repeat space with v to change the order in which the files are viewed.  Space with v is a toggle.  The choices are name order, date order, size order, or type of file order.  Explore this option by using space with v to toggle to a different order type.  Look at your list of files to see how this impacts how your files are ordered.
		            
		      \item To copy the pointed to file, press backspace with y.  Try this now.  You will need to choose the destination folder for the file to be placed in.  However, the file is just being copied.  The original will remain in the location it was copied from in the first place.
		            
		      \item Backspace with m will "move" a file.  If you move a file, it will no longer remain in its original location.  Keep in mind that moving a file and copying a file are similar, but not quite the same.
		            
		      \item You can rename the "pointed to" file.  Press enter with r, then type the new name.  Press enter when you finish.
		            
		      \item Backspace with p will protect or unprotect a "pointed to" file.  When you use this command on a file in the list, you will then need to press p to protect the file, u to unprotect the file, or enter to leave the option unchanged.  If you protect a file, when you are actually in the file you will be unable to make changes to the file.
		            
		      \item You can mark a file or mark all files.  Space with m will mark the pointed to file.  Enter with low g will mark all files.
		            
		      \item Backspace with m will move marked files if you have any marked.  Otherwise, backspace with m will move the pointed to file.
		            
		      \item You can copy the marked items or delete the marked items.  Backspace with y will copy the marked items.  Backspace with dots1 4 will delete the marked items.
		            
		      \item As time, use the above commands to become more familiar with how efficient they can be when managing files.
